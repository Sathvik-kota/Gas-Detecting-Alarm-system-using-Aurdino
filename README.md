# Gas-Detecting-Alarm-system-using-Aurdino
This project demonstrates a gas leakage detection system that uses an Arduino UNO R3 along with a gas sensor, LEDs, a buzzer, and an LCD display to detect and alert about gas leaks. 
It's perfect for making fire alarms, gas leak detectors, or home safety systems!
