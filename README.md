# Gas-Detecting-Alarm-system-using-Aurdino

This system can be used by operators in the area where the leak is occurring can be alerted by a gas detector, giving them the chance to evacuate. Because many gases may be hazardous to biological life, such as people or animals, this sort of equipment is essential. Increased levels of these gases in the atmosphere will be highly hazardous. 

This project demonstrates a gas leakage detection system that uses an Arduino UNO R3 along with a gas sensor, LEDs, a buzzer, and an LCD display to detect and alert about gas leaks. 
It's perfect for making fire alarms, gas leak detectors, or home safety systems!
