# Gas-Detecting-Alarm-system-using-Aurdino
This project demonstrates a gas leakage detection system that uses an Arduino UNO R3 along with a gas sensor, LEDs, a buzzer, and an LCD display to detect and alert about gas leaks. 
It's perfect for making fire alarms, gas leak detectors, or home safety systems! 

# Components required
<ul>
<li>
  
**ARDUINO UNO R3** :-The core microcontroller board.
**LCD display 16 x 2** :- To show sensor values and status messages.
**Breadboard** :- For connecting the components.
**Gas Sensor** :-To sense LPG, smoke, or other combustible gases.
**Piezo Speaker** :-Provides an audible alarm when gas is detected.
**LED light** :- Indicates gas leakage (RED) , Indicates the normal (safe) state(GREEN) .
